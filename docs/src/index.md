# A Toolbox for Solving Dynamic Rational Inattention Problems

This notebook explains how to solve LQG Dynamic Rational Inattention models using the methods and the [solver](https://github.com/choongryulyang/dynamic_multivariate_RI) from [Afrouzi and Yang (2019)](http://www.afrouzi.com/dynamic_inattention.pdf) that was adapted for Julia by the authors and [Miguel Acosta](https://www.acostamiguel.com/home).
